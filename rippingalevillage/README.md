===========================
This is where all the code for my edits to the village website will go. The changes will include:
+ adding php support to the events diary so that a database can be used. This will:
  - allow events to be easily updated and created
  - allow the webpage to automatically update when new events are created
  - make it easier to update how the events are displayed to the user
+ create a C.M.S. to help add events and information to the website
